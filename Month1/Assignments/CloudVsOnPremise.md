## What is cloud
Cloud stands for cloud computing as per NIST and is a model having a network, servers, storage, applications, and services that can be called to use on-demand(convenience)
## Cloud Computing analogy:
A utility company has dedicated departments for dedicated services like electricity, water and gas which is tiresome to manage now cloud providers on the other hand do all these things for you, and cost you as you use them
Demand self-service (like a faucet)
- Share resource pooling(like which water comes from which reservoir)
- Rapid Elasticity(like increasing the amount of water provided)
- Measured Service(like water bills)
- Broad Network Access(any number of connected faucets for water)
## Cloud deployment Models:
- Public(cloud) general public open use, deployment easy, AWS on-premise infrastructure of cloud provider
- Private(on-premise) by a single organization, network on-site, corporate network
- Community
- hybrid
