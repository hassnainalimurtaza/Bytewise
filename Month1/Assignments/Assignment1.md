## Traditional Architecture:
The on-premise solution to store the data in a secure environment called data centres containing servers and storage tech. Maintenance of this architecture is difficult as power shortage issues, cooling, and onboard staff to maintain the systems and their specific place to work. Accessibility can be dangerous as a person can enter and record the weak points, this issue is also required to cater. Also, hardware can get outdated as new tech provides feasible solutions. Disasters can happen which require a proactive approach to overcome. If we want to increase our storage or scale it's difficult as these all variables are required to cater for, making it limited to scale, under sudden loads during different events. To make these things work meetings and resources are also required to manage.

## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing means providing the services such as storage, servers, databases, and networking tools over the internet. This helps us to focus on the business rather than finding solutions to traditional infrastructure problems. So cloud service providers handle these issues for us and charge us on the go (the more you use the more you get charged). These services are provided on rent and cost us cheaper if you consider the whole cost we are paying for the traditional architecture.

## Cloud Computing Characteristics:
- On-demand service, no waiting required to get the required servic- e
- Broad Network Access, can be accessed from anywhere due to the internet 
- Resource Pooling, as resources are shared it costs less as the amount is divided among consumers.
- Rapid Elasticity, increasing of resources is easy and fast
- Measured Services, pay for how much service is utilized
## Benefits of Cloud Computing :
- Highly Scalable(increase in large amount as per traffic)
- More Flexible(Can be increased or decreased as per usage)
- Reduced Infrastructure Cost(After earning payment can be done)
- Higher Security(we do not know where data is stored to theft)
- Back-up and disaster recovery(if any server fails we have a reliable backup)
- No location constraint(can be accessed from anywhere by the consumer)
## Cloud Service Models :
Classification based on service proving by companies
### Traditional Infrastructure:
Things a consumer has to manage:
- Application( our software )
- Data(required for working of software)
- Runtime(manage the running of software in the actual environment)
- Middleware(dependencies)
- OS(for running our software on)
- Virtualization(to efficiently use our hardware)
- Servers(to manage the computing)
- Storage(for storing misc data)
- Networking(for communication of components)
### Infrastructure as a Service:
Example: EC2 instance + storage creating a virtual machine
Activities that cloud services manage for us:
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking
### Platform as a Service:
Platform services manage the following activities:
Example: relational database service, AWS elastic beanstalk 
- Runtime
- Middleware
- OS
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### Software as a Service:
The following activities are taken care of by the cloud service provider:
Example: Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook etc
- Application( our software )
- Data(required for working of software)
- Runtime(manage the running of software in the actual environment)
- Middleware(dependencies)
- OS(for running our software on)
- Virtualization(to efficiently use our hardware)
- Servers(to manage the computing)
- Storage(for storing misc data)
- Networking(for communication of components)


## Cloud Deployment Models:
Classification based on deployment of infrastructure on the cloud
### Public Cloud:
Example: vaccinated regions showcasing names of cities only

**Pros:**
1. Cheap
2. Accessible to any user
**Cons:**
1. Less secure

### Hybrid Cloud:
Example: Results of students after board exams

**Pros:**
1. Secure specific data
2. Both features of private and public 

**Cons:**
1. none

### Private Cloud:
Example: Bank details

**Pros:**
1. Secure
2. Admin/specific access only
**Cons:**
1. Cost High
2. Requires traditional data centre staffing and maintenance
