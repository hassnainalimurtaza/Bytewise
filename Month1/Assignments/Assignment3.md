## Learn the Basics
### AWS Cloud Intro
What is AWS Cloud?
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform.
- The first product (S3) was released in 2006.
- AWS has grown a lot since then in both size and product range.
- It is, to date, the largest cloud provider in the world.

### AWS Cloud Computing
**The Client-Server Model:**
The Client-Server model is about a client that interacts and makes requests to a computer server

### What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing is a computing service made available over the internet.
- Cloud computing is a pay-as-you-go model for delivering IT resources.
- You pay only for what you use.

### Deployment Models
There are three different kinds of deployment models:
- Cloud-based
- On-premises
- Hybrid

The models are different ways of accessing compute services - over the internet, locally, or in combination.
### Cloud-Based Deployment
- Everything runs in the cloud.
- This model allows you to build new applications or move existing ones to the cloud.
- There are different levels of services ranging from low to high.
- The level of service has different requirements for your management, architecting, and infrastructure.

For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components entirely based in the cloud.

### On-Premises Deployment
- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- On-Premises Deployment is also known as private cloud deployment.

For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data centre.
Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its application management and virtualization technologies make it more effective

### Hybrid Deployment
- In a hybrid deployment, you connect cloud resources to an on-premises infrastructure.
- This approach is relevant in many situations.

For example, you are working with sensitive data or are under specific government regulations.

## AWS Cloud Benefits
- Cost savings
- Security
- Scalability
- Flexibility

### Payment Model
- The cloud payment model is flexible.
- You do not have to invest in a data centre, servers, and other resources.
- Cloud services are a variable expense.
- You can use the services from the start and consume more as you grow.

**Fewer Operations**
- Having your own data centres and servers requires resources and staffing.
- Cloud computing reduces operation and lets you focus on important things, such as your applications and customers.

**Flexible Capacity**
- Having and managing your own servers can result in unused capacity and limitations.
- On the other hand, you can grow freely with cloud computing.
- You pay for what you use

**Economies at Scale**
- Cloud computing is about shared resources.
- Sharing the infrastructure cost with hundreds of thousands of other customers lowers the overall costs.

**Increased Speed**
* The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications.
* You can test and utilize resources as you want in minutes.
* This freedom allows you to experiment and invent more.
* It allows for instant resource access.

**Global Reach**
* AWS has data centres all over the world.
* The AWS Cloud's global reach allows you to swiftly deploy apps to consumers anywhere.
* Customers can access your apps quickly.
* You can pick the ones near your clients to reduce the latency.
