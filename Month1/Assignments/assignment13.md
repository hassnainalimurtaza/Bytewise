## AWS Trusted Advisor
AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow the recommendations to optimize your services and resources.
AWS Basic Support and AWS Developer Support customers can access core security checks and checks for service quotas. AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support customers can access all checks, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service quotas. For a complete list of checks and descriptions, see the Trusted Advisor Best Practices.
AWS Trusted Advisor Priority helps you focus on the most important recommendations to optimize your cloud deployments, improve resilience, and address security gaps. Available to AWS Enterprise Support customers, Trusted Advisor Priority provides prioritized and context-driven recommendations that come from your AWS account team as well as machine-generated checks from AWS services.
### Benefits
* Cost optimization(identifying idle RDS DB instances, underutilized EBS volumes, unassociated Elastic IP addresses, and excessive timeouts in Lambda functions.)
* Performance(analyzing EBS throughput and latency, compute usage of EC2 instances, and configurations on CloudFront)
* Security(RDS security group access risk, exposed access keys, and unnecessary S3 bucket permissions)
* Fault tolerance(Auto scaling EC2 groups, deleted health checks on Route 53, disabled Availability Zones, and disabled RDS backups)
* Service quotas(Trusted Advisor will notify you once you reach more than 80% of a service quota)

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) leverages AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate your business outcomes through innovative use of AWS. AWS CAF identifies specific organizational capabilities that underpin successful cloud transformations. These capabilities provide best practice guidance that helps you improve your cloud readiness. AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. Each perspective comprises a set of capabilities that functionally related stakeholders own or manage in the cloud transformation journey. Use the AWS CAF to identify and prioritize transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve your cloud readiness, and iteratively evolve your transformation roadmap
* Reduce business risk(reliability, increased performance, and enhanced security)
* Improve environmental, social, and governance performance(sustainability and corporate transparency.)
* Grow revenue(new customers, and enter new market segments.)
* Increase operational efficiency(productivity, and improve employee and customer experience)
