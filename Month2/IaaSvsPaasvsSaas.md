# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS:

* IaaS, or infrastructure as a service, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud. 
* PaaS, or platform as a service, is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.
* SaaS, or software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.

## IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, is a step away from on-premises infrastructure. It’s a pay-as-you-go service where a third party provides you with infrastructure services, like storage and virtualization, as you need them, via a cloud, through the internet. As the user, you are responsible for the operating system and any data, applications, middleware, and runtimes, but a provider gives you access to, and management of, the network, servers, virtualization, and storage you need. You don’t have to maintain or update your own on-site datacenter because the provider does it for you. Instead, you access and control the infrastructure via an application programming interface (API) or dashboard. IaaS gives you flexibility to purchase only the components you need and scale them up or down as needed. There’s low overhead and no maintenance costs, making IaaS a very affordable option. One way to use IaaS would be as a quick, flexible way to build up and take down and development and testing environments. You can use only the infrastructure you need to create your development environment—and scale it up or down—for as long as you need it, and then you can stop when you’re finished, paying only for what you use. The main drawbacks to IaaS are the possibilities of provider security issues, multi-tenant systems where the provider must share infrastructure resources with multiple clients, and service reliability. These drawbacks can be avoided by choosing a reliable and trustworthy provider with a solid history and reputation. 
Public cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are examples of IaaS.

## PaaS
PaaS provides a cloud-based platform for developing, running, managing applications.  The cloud services provider hosts, manages and maintains all the hardware and software included in the platform - servers (for development, testing and deployment), operating system (OS) software, storage, networking, databases, middleware, runtimes, frameworks, development tools - as well as related services for security, operating system and software upgrades, backups and more.Users access the PaaS through a graphical user interface (GUI), where development or DevOps teams can collaborate on all their work across the entire application lifecycle including coding, integration, testing, delivery, deployment, and feedback. 
Examples of PaaS solutions include  AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.

## SaaS: Software as a Service
Software as a Service, also known as cloud application services, represents the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. A majority of SaaS applications run directly through your web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.
Dropbox, Salesforce, Google Apps, and Red Hat Insights are some examples of SaaS.
